** Overview
This tool accepts NMEA data forwarded over TCP, parses a small number of NMEA sentences, and forwards them to MQTT.

The configuration file is named =gps-proxy.yml=, searched in the [[https://golang.org/pkg/os/#UserConfigDir][users configuration directory]], or in /etc if not found there. The configuration looks as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
port: 8500
host: 10.10.10.1
mqtt_user: username
mqtt_password: password
mqtt_host: mqtt.example.com
clients:
  - ip: 10.10.10.10
    name: car
  - ip: 127.0.0.1
    name: test-access
#+END_SRC

The =host= field is optional. If omitted the service binds to =0.0.0.0=.

An arbitrary number of clients can be specified. Only clients in the list may connect.

Note that the protocol does not allow for proper security, so should be tunneled over a secure connection (like a VPN). The client list should not be seen as access control, but only as a method to easily support writing values of multiple clients to MQTT.

Data is published under =gps-proxy/<name>/<NMEA header>/=. When mosquitto_sub is available data can be checked using =mosquitto_sub -h mqtt.example.com -t "gps-proxy/car/#=
